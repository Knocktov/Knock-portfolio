Website created using HTML and CSS. @Media tags adjusted to fit multiple different screen resolutions.

Thank you for coming to my TEDta-...I mean Readme. This page was created to act as a portfolio of projects for future clients and act as a landing page for anyone looking
to see my showcase of skills. This website is a continuous work in progress and will be updated as my skills and understanding of programming grows.
